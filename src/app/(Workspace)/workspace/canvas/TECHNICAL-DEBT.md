# Canvas Module: Technical Debt Assessment

This document outlines the current technical debt in the Canvas module and provides recommendations for addressing these issues to improve code quality, maintainability, and performance.

## Executive Summary

The Canvas module is a sophisticated diagramming tool with strong core functionality, but has accumulated technical debt in several areas. Key issues include:

1. **Large Component Files**: Some components have grown too large and should be refactored
2. **State Management Complexity**: The Zustand store has accumulated numerous functions
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Several areas could benefit from performance improvements
4. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Insufficient test coverage for critical functionality
5. **Accessibility Issues**: Limited keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Code Organization and Structure

#### 1.1 Oversized Components

| Component | Lines | Issue | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Canvas.tsx | ~2200+ | Too many responsibilities | Split into smaller focused components |
| canvas-store.ts | ~2600+ | Too many state slices and actions | Refactor into modular sub-stores |

**Actions needed:**
- Refactor `Canvas.tsx` into smaller sub-components with focused responsibilities
- Extract event handling logic into custom hooks
- Split canvas-store.ts into logical modules (e.g., shapes, lines, selection, history)

#### 1.2 Duplicate or Similar Code

Several utility functions for shape manipulation, connection points, and line routing have similar logic that could be consolidated.

**Actions needed:**
- Create unified geometry utilities for shape calculations
- Standardize coordinate transformation functions
- Implement better abstraction for connection point calculations

### 2. State Management

#### 2.1 Complex State Updates

The current implementation mixes Immer-based state updates with manual object cloning in some places, leading to inconsistent patterns.

**Actions needed:**
- Ensure consistent use of Immer throughout state updates
- Add proper TypeScript type guards for state properties
- Consider selector optimization to prevent unnecessary rerenders

#### 2.2 History Management

The undo/redo system works but has edge cases where state isn't properly captured.

**Actions needed:**
- Implement a more robust command pattern for history
- Add state diffing to reduce memory usage for history states
- Fix edge cases with grouped operations and connection updates

### 3. Performance Issues

#### 3.1 Rendering Optimization

| Issue | Impact | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Excessive rerenders | Sluggish UI with many nodes | Implement proper memoization |
| No virtualization | Poor performance with 100+ elements | Add viewport-based rendering |
| Large state objects | Memory usage and GC pauses | Optimize state shape and references |

**Actions needed:**
- Implement React.memo for all pure components
- Add virtualization for large canvases
- Use windowing techniques for rendering only visible nodes

#### 3.2 Event Handling

Mouse event handling is not optimized and can cause lag with many elements.

**Actions needed:**
- Debounce/throttle mouse move events
- Implement pointer capture for better drag operations
- Optimize hit testing algorithm for element selection

### 4. Testing

#### 4.1 Test Coverage

| Area | Current Coverage | Target |
|------|------------------|--------|
| Core components | ~40% | 80%+ |
| State logic | ~30% | 90%+ |
| UI interactions | ~20% | 75%+ |

**Actions needed:**
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all state actions
- Implement integration tests for common user flows
- Add visual regression tests for shape rendering

#### 4.2 Test Infrastructure

The current testing setup lacks proper mocking for canvas operations and event simulation.

**Actions needed:**
- Create better mocks for canvas context and DOM events
- Set up testing utilities for common operations
- Implement snapshot testing for component output

### 5. Accessibility

The canvas has limited keyboard navigation and lacks proper ARIA attributes for screen readers.

**Actions needed:**
- Implement keyboard navigation for all canvas operations
- Add proper focus management for interactive elements
- Include ARIA attributes for screen reader support
- Create high-contrast mode for better visibility

### 6. Documentation

While overall documentation is good, API documentation is incomplete.

**Actions needed:**
- Document all exported components and hooks with JSDoc
- Create API reference for canvas-store actions
- Add inline comments explaining complex algorithms

### 7. Browser Compatibility

Some advanced features use APIs not available in all browsers.

**Actions needed:**
- Implement polyfills for clipboard API
- Test and fix Safari-specific rendering issues
- Ensure touch interaction works on mobile devices

## Prioritized Recommendations

### High Priority (Next 1-2 Sprints)

1. Refactor Canvas.tsx into smaller components
2. Split canvas-store.ts into logical modules
3. Fix performance issues with large diagrams
4. Implement proper memoization throughout

### Medium Priority (Next 3-4 Sprints)

1. Improve test coverage for core functionality
2. Implement basic keyboard navigation
3. Fix history management edge cases
4. Standardize geometry and connection utilities

### Low Priority (Future Improvements)

1. Complete documentation with JSDoc
2. Add advanced accessibility features
3. Implement full browser compatibility
4. Optimize for mobile/touch devices

## Conclusion

While the Canvas module provides strong functionality, addressing these technical debt issues will significantly improve its maintainability, performance, and extensibility. The prioritized approach allows for incremental improvements without disrupting current usage.

## Monitoring Metrics

To track progress on technical debt reduction, we recommend monitoring:

1. Component size (lines of code)
2. Cyclomatic complexity
3. Test coverage percentage
4. Performance benchmarks (FPS, memory usage)
5. Number of reported bugs and issues
